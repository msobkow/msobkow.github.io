# msobkow.github.io
The logical domains org.msscf and io.github.msobkow are not registered and hosted on the public internet per se, as I'm retired and largely coding for fun. There is a chance of someday making money from this work of mine, this windmill, but for now it gets nothing but my time and use of my hardware. And for-free internet services.
