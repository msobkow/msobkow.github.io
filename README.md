Mark Stephen Sobkow's Code Factory 3.1 (MssCF)

The logical domain server.markhome.msscf is not registered and hosted on the public internet, as this project is currently under internal development and virtually hosted in my own network. Any code released at this point for the 3.1 version will therefore be very much a preview/prerelease and far from official.

My intent is to license the bulk of the code under Apache V2, in particular the code manufactured for the core objects and IO facilities, but not the custom code modules or the rule base associated with the tool. Those will be under a dual GPLv3/commercial license, including CFCore, a key component of the technology that has been developed to support the code manufacturing process, with myself providing the commercial licenses.

As such, the tool itself will be released under GPLv3/commercial, and therefore useable "as is" when appropriately built and configured.
