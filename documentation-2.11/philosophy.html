As a general rule, I believe that knowledge is free.
Anyone can pick up a book or surf the internet and learn.
This isn't a recent change; it's been true for as long
as there have been public libraries.
<p>
So when Richard Stallman came around the University of
Saskatchewan in the early 1980's, preaching the gospel
of the GPL (GNU General Public License) and LGPL
(Lesser or Library GNU General Public License), he found
a host of interested ears in the university student
population.  Many an hour were spent debating the merits
of the GPL and LGPL and the edification of common knowledge.
<p>
Remember, while we had email capabilities back then, we really
didn't have an internet yet.  We couldn't envision any way of
sharing code other than to post updates regularly for download
from the news feeds, or to find someone with an FTP server
we could use to host tarballs.
<p>
We all understood what we wanted to do -- build a knowledge
space dedicated to the principle that the knowledge itself should
be free to all, especially the code that is used to build
the space.  Digital Space must remain free if all of humanity
is to benefit as it should.
<p>
In the purest sense, the GPL was anarchy from the rebellious
university youth.  Who knew so many of us would turn out to be
successful career programmers with influence on the business
environment far beyond our individuality?
<p>
I later reconsidered the strict demand for changes to be released
under the GPL, and decided even that was too restrictive compared
to the true freedom of the Apache license, so I shifted license
camps after many a year of using Apache code on my projects.  If it
is good enough for me to use, it should be good enough to distribute
under, eh?
<p>
Open source has taken over the majority of the computing world.
I firmly believe that it's inevitable for this to happen, because
those willing to contribute their knowledge to the knowledge pool
are a steady trickle of drops downwards.  Each drop is small,
but look at the size of the ocean they splash into and build!
