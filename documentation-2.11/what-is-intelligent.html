MSS Code Factory 2.11: What Is Intelligent About It?
</H2></CENTER>
<p>
The scope of MSS Code Factory 2.11's knowledge is determined by the keys used
to identify and locate specific generation items (rules, file expansions, and
such) within the knowledge base.  The key attributes are
<ul>
<li>the toolset (name),</li>
<li>the scope class name,</li>
<li>the generation item name, and</li>
<li>the rule name.</li>
</ul>
<p>
MSS Code Factory 2.11 is "intelligent" primarily in the way it generalizes
concepts to broaden the scope of its search for applicable rules within
the knowledge base.  The implementation of this "intelligence" is in the
CFCore 2.12 library, accessed by specializing the MssCF layer within CFCore.
<p>
It is also optimized through the use of hash maps wherever possible
to improve search probe performance.
<p>
The toolset name is the first attribute searched, identifying a
potentially-empty collection of generation items whose toolset name
is always that of this toolset.
<p>
Within a toolset collection, a hash map of rule names is formed, making
it extremely efficient to quickly determine if there are any candidates
suitable for the rule name that is being probed.
<p>
The hash map of rule names contains a sub-collection of generation items
grouped by scope class name.  Within that is another hash map and sub-collection
of gen item names.
<p>
This sequence of hash maps takes what could have been a very expensive key probe
and makes the performance an impressive aspect of efficiency of
MSS Code Factory's "thought process."
<p>
If a matching key isn't found when probing the current generation item name,
the superclass definition for the generation item becomes the current generation
item name, and the probes are repeated.
<p>
If no matching key can be found when probing the current scope class name,
the superclass definition for the scope class becomes the current scope class
name, and the probes over the set of generation item names is repeated.
<p>
If there still is no matching key found during this probe of the current toolset, 
the toolset name is truncated at the last '+' character, and the system searches
within that toolset instead, repeating the probes by scope class name and generation
item name.
<p>
Finally, when there are no more toolsets to search, one final attempt is made at
searching the any toolset, after which if no key can be found, that key is treated
as unresolvable (which results as it appearing as $RuleName$ in the manufactured code.)
<p>
Through this logic, MSS Code Factory 2.11 exhibits an ability to generalize keys
with a pattern-matching inference-engine capability, using the approach to evaluate it's
hierarchies of both modelled and persistent data.  Although rather old-school,
inference engines are an important part of most AI toolkits, and are well known
for their performance aspects.
