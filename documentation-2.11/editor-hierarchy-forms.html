<p>
The network hierarchy form is the first one you see when you launch the
CFBam Editor.  From here, you can add internet object nodes, licenses,
and schema definitions (you should only have one of those per model.)
<p>
With a schema selected, you can also validate the schema's design, and
save the schema to a file.  When you save a schema, a default file name
is produced and the save dialog starts in the first directory on your
model path from the $HOME/.msscfrc file.
<p>
Which objects you can add to a given node varies based on the type of
node currenty selected.  The nesting levels are limited -- you can define
a TLD, a Top Domain, a Domain, a Top Project, a Sub Project, and then your
Major Version and Minor Version nodes.  That is usually quite sufficient
for locating source code ownership within a company domain, so no further
levels are allowed.

<p>
A TLD node is an internet top level domain -- usually .com, .net, .org,
.mil, or a two-character country domain.

<H4><A id="AddTopDomain">Add Top Domain</A></H4>
<p>
A Top Domain the name of the domain that was registered with a
domain name registration service provider.  You can provide
a description for the domain for the sake of documentation, but
it is not used by the rule base during processing.

<H4><A id="AddLicense">Add License</A></H4>
<p>
Licenses are typically set up for a given company, or are
from some internet publication like Apache.org's Apache V2 license
or GNU.org's GPLv3.  When you add a License, it is the Embedded Text
that is important -- this text gets incorporated in the headers of
the files produced by the manufacturing process.
<p>
Because those headers include XML and HTML documents, you must not
include any unescaped markup characters in the embedded text, or you'll
have trouble with invalid documents.
<p>

<p>
<H4><A id="AddTopProject">Add Top Project</A></H4>
<p>
You must always define a Top Project for a business application
model.  This name is used to build the name of your project's
source tree.  As with most names in a business application model,
the Name has to be camelcase.  That is, it has to start with an
uppercase character and include one or more lowercase characters
in the remaining part of the string.

<p>
<A href="#top">Back to top</A>
<p>
<H4><A id="AddSubProject">Add Sub Project</A></H4>
<p>
You can define Sub Projects as well.  These are used to allow
you to have several schemas modelled under a single project tree,
each of which will have its own independent persistent storage
server provisioned.  Note that there would be no transaction
coordination between those stores if you were to access more
than one from a given application; each store is completely
independent of the others.

<p>
<H4><A id="AddMajorVersion">Add Major Version</A></H4>
<p>
I have never modelled a project without specifying both the
Major and Minor Version numbers, with both of those being
integers.  I strongly recommend that you do so as well, and
that you not specify "0" as a version.  You are free to try
manufacturing a project that does not specify major and minor
version numbes, but I have no idea how the factory will react
to a specification that lacks them.

<p>
<H4><A id="AddSchema">Add Schema</A></H4>
<p>
There should be one and only one schema defined for a given
model file.  While the rule base does allow for there to be
more than one schema defined by a business application model
file, the CFBam Editor does not.
<p>
The database name for a schema should not be more than 8 characters,
as some databases do not allow schema file names longer than that.
However, because nothing requires that you deploy your application
on all of the supported server technologies, you are not forced to
limit yourself to 8 characters.  Just be aware that it can cause
problems should you decide to use alternative database technologies
in the future.

<p>
Validating a model helps to ensure that your model will result
in valid code when you manufacture it.  However, due to the complexity
of the rule base, validation does not guarantee success.  It just
catches the most common mistakes and oversights that people make
when modelling an application schema.
