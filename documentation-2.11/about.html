<CENTER><H2>About MSS Code Factory 2.11</H2></CENTER>
<p>
MSS Code Factory 2.11 is a model-to-source code manufacturing tool designed to capture
a knowledge engineer's (i.e. programmer's) coding architecture and style through
a General Expansion Language (GEL) XML syntax.
<p>
It produces a Java 13 Object-Relational Management caching architecture
with pluggable persistent storage to DB/2 LUW, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle,
and PostgreSQL, as well as an in-memory RAM repository.
<p>
It also produces a structured SAX XML parser for loading databases, and an
X(ml)Msg implementation for client-server communications.
<p>
It produces an XMsgSrv WAR file and an SM (Security Manager) WAR file for
deployment to unsecured and HTTPS-secured web servers, respectively.
<p>
Note that the security implemented over the HTTP connection requires that you
have the unlimited strength cryptography installed on both your client and your
server.  I'm not interested in "watering down" security for anyone.
<p>
<H3>What is "A Fractal Programming System"?</H3>
<p>
MSS Code Factory 2 is what I call a "Fractal Programming" system.  It uses
a rule base to specify a code fractal with mathematical precision, that is
expanded based on those rules to produce predictable code.
<p>
It is also a self-maintaining system, in that its intial core focus
was to create an expert system that would author domain-specific
expert systems recursively.
<p>
Each generation "breeds" the next by writing the bulk of it. There have
been 10 generations of the tool to get to this point (1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.1,
2.3, 2.5, 2.7., 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and now 2.11.)
<p>
<H3>What is it like to work with an infinite team of junior coders?</H3>
<p>
When I work with MSS Code Factory 2 on the rule base for producing 
applications, it is just like working with an infinite team of junior coders, all just
waiting to implement whatever change I've made to the project "templates" (rules), and
delivering the results in mere minutes.
<p>
It takes far, far longer to build and test the resulting code than it does to produce
the code in the first place.
<p>
<H3>What MSS Code Factory 2 does for you...</H3>
<P>
By using MSS Code Factory 2, your projects will see:
<ul>
<li>Improved delivery time.  No one can
	edit a few thousand objects as fast as you can with this tool.
	No one.  It's physically impossible for human developers to type
	fast enough, no matter how many offshore juniors you can afford to
	hire.</li>
<li>Reduced development costs.  As the rulebases grow and are extended,
	more and more application code becomes automated and a fixed per-enterprise
	lease becomes a negligable cost.</li>
<li>Consistent modelling.  The tool uses an XML-based application model,
	forcing the business developer to think in object-relational mapping
	terms as the core of their business modelling efforts.  You can easily
	write an XML parser that will allow you to import the model to your own
	modelling tools, or you can follow the GPLv3 and use the existing
	MSS Code Factory 2 code base.</li>
<li>Reduced testing costs.  As the rulesets are exercised and stabilized,
	there will be no further need to test new application objects that
	are added to the model, because they follow the same patterns as the
	objects created and tested in the past.</li>
<li>Support your ISO9000 and Six Sigma efforts by developing your own
	extensions to the rule base.  The transformation from
	model to code is encapsulated by an ever-growing rule base, with
	constant feedback to correct any defects in the manufactured code.
	The system learns not to repeat the same mistake, improving not only
	your current applications, but all future applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Licensing, the GPLv3, and Apache V2 core code freedoms</H3>
<p>
All of the MSS Code Factory 2 projects are under an Apache V2
license so that you can incorporate and extend them as part of your
project models.
<p>
<H4>Projects under the Apache V2 license, for reference/import by any project</H4>
<p>
You must be compliant with Apache V2 requirements for the following
projects.  You are not allowed to use the GPLv2 with manufactured code,
because it is incompatible with the Apache V2 license used by core
libraries.  GPLv3 is compatible with Apache V2.
