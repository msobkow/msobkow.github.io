<p>
Nowadays some companies are preaching the LLM as the latest "silver bullet" solution to the dilemmas of programmer
productivity and errors, but they won't succeed, because LLMs aren't actually <i>intelligent</i>.  They don't
<i>know</i> what you're talking about or <i>understand</i> it.  What they do is apply some incredibly complex
statistics to <i>guess</i> what you probably mean based on other people who've asked similar things over the
years of data that were scraped and ground into the LLM's statistical data core. And LLMs are proving to be
just as error prone as their human counterparts, just in different but equally frustrating and problematic ways.
<p>
There has to be a solution, and I think I've found it by merging together aspects of compiler technology,
data analysis logic, expert systems approaches, functional programming method search techniques, and decades
upon decades of <i>experience</i> in front of a keyboard to come up with something "new." New to the world, at least,
but not new to me - this technology began existence around Java 1.6... it got up to 2.13 so far, and now 3.1 is being
worked on, which refreshes the whole underlying approach to take advantage of much newer programming technologies.
<p>
In a very big way, when you use 3.1 after it's initial release, you're using <i>me</i> to write code for you!  You're using
me to <i>precisely</i> follow your design to produce a <i>code fractal</i> - an expression of your model so predictable that
it is fractal-like in it's nature, but without the vagaries and inconsistencies of LLM-generated code that try to do the
same thing through mere statistics.
<p>
The key concepts that come together are functional method searching combined with a reverse LALR grammar specification
done through XML documents and a sufficiently robust Business Application Model that provides the "design" the expansions
follow.  For performance reasons, many aspects are implemented in "xxxcust" packages of custom code that enhance the
manufactured fractal code.
<p>
It's worth noting that each earlier generation of MSS Code Factory wrote the fractal code for the generation to follow.
What you are about to witness in a few short months with 3.1 is the culmination of 14 generations of code evolution and design
over nearly 30 years time.
<p>
Despite it's age, I don't think the idea is obsolete. I think the core tenet of ISO9000 feedback is <i>crucial</i> to solving
the software reliability problem, and I think this tool is going to prove very useful in finally providing a means of <i>implementing</i>
such feedback corrections.
